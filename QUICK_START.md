# Plant Identifier App - Quick Start Guide (Non-Technical)

## What You Have

Your app is **completely built and ready to go**. No coding needed from here on.

## The Simple 4-Step Process

### Step 1: Create Your Developer Accounts (One-Time Setup)

You need accounts on 3 app stores to sell your app. Think of these like storefronts.

**For iPhone (Apple App Store):**
1. Go to https://developer.apple.com
2. Click "Account" and sign up
3. Pay $99/year (one-time)
4. Verify your identity (takes 1-2 days)

**For Android (Google Play):**
1. Go to https://play.google.com/console
2. Sign up with your Google account
3. Pay $25 one-time (never again)
4. You're done

**For Amazon (Optional):**
1. Go to https://developer.amazon.com
2. Sign up
3. No fee required

### Step 2: Set Up Your Subscriptions in Each Store

In each app store, you'll create 3 subscription options:
- **Basic**: £2.99/month
- **Plus**: £9.99/month
- **Premium**: £19.99/month

**How to do this:**
1. Log into each app store developer account
2. Create a new app called "Plant Identifier"
3. Add 3 in-app purchases with the prices above
4. That's it - the app handles the rest

### Step 3: Build Your App

This creates the actual app file that goes to the stores.

**One command:**
```
npm run build
```

This takes 10-15 minutes and creates files ready for the app stores.

### Step 4: Upload to App Stores

**For each app store:**
1. Log in
2. Click "Upload App"
3. Select the file created in Step 3
4. Fill in basic info (description, screenshots, etc.)
5. Click "Submit"

**That's it!** Your app will be reviewed in 24-48 hours.

## What Happens Next

1. **Apple reviews** your app (24-48 hours)
2. **Google reviews** your app (2-4 hours)
3. Your app goes **live** on all stores
4. People can download it for free
5. They pay £2.99/£9.99/£19.99 for subscriptions
6. **You get paid** automatically each month

## The Money

- **Apple takes 30%** of each subscription
- **Google takes 30%** of each subscription
- **You keep 70%**

Example: If 100 people buy the £9.99 plan:
- Monthly revenue: £999
